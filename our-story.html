							<h2>An Unlikely Meeting</h2>
							<span>Thanks to Zach</span>
							<p>Lindsay and I met on Tinder. I swope on her because she had a comment about how she was giving Tinder one last try, and was done with online dating. I had been feeling that Tinder was an awful app, and was at my end too. Before I ever heard back from her, I quit Tinder. Somehow...as things tend to happen in my life, I got a notification that Lindsay had swope on me too (or as I learned later, maybe it was Zach). Confused, because I thought I had disabled Tinder, I thought "Alright, she likes me too so I'll give this one last shot".</p>
							<p>One thing I noticed immediately was that she had a Masters from the University of Anchorage, which was strange but she was clearly from Minnesota. She was very clear from the outset that she lived in Alaska, and was not moving. I was very clear that that was ok, she was just fun to talk to. So we kept talking. For 4 days we talked, and finally the day before Lindsay left to go back home, we had our first date.</p>
							<p>Our first date was good, but I was new to dating and I was incredibly awkward at the end...not sure if we should hug, kiss, shake hands. So it ended with an awkward hug. She went on her way to Alaska, and I stayed in Minnesota. But we just kept talking</p>
							<h2>California</h2>
							<span>Our first trip</span>
							<p>We talked on the phone every night from then on out. We even had our second date over Skype. Lindsay, as I now understand about her, had had her brain hijacked by me...if I was "the one". And in true Lindsay style, she had to figure out if I was, and if I was take action...and if not, stop talking to me and wasting so much time (seriously, we talked around 3 hours every night on the phone). So she asked if I would meet her in California</p>
							<p>Originally, I said yes...but didn't really mean it, it was more of a "Yeah sure, that will happen someday". I was very nervous about it...going off to meet a girl in California is not something I would normally do. She called my bluff, and was asking when we could go. Ultimately I agreed, and we met up in Sacramento - where we had our THIRD date at the Shady Lady the night we landed, and began our first roadtrip.</p>
							<p>We spent 5 days together in California, and drove from Sacramento to the Redwoods. We had no plans of where to stay or what to do when we got there. It was the journey that mattered. We hiked in the woods, stayed at random motels, and began to fall in love. I knew this to be true when - while trying to break-and-enter into an abandoned amusement park - Lindsay proclaimed "Pull over, I have to pee!" And right there, in Guerneville...she peed on the side of the road. I knew this was something special.</p>
							<h2>Washington D.C.</h2>
							<span>The best day ever</span>
							<p>Two weeks after California, we both found ourselves on the East coast for work. I was in Connecticut, and Lindsay in D.C. I had finished up my tasks early, and told her I could meet her down in DC for 2 days before my flight left. And so I drove. I got to Lindsay's hotel, knocked, and heard a literal SHRIEK of excitement as she jumped up to answer the door. This night would end up being our first night working at a restaurant together - something that would become a favorite pastime of ours.</p>
							<p>The story of D.C. itself is incredibly long, suffice to say neither of us are big fans of D.C., but...it was the best day ever. We spent the whole day walking, talking, Lindsay said "I Love you" first at the end of the day, and texted her friends that she was going to marry me. I didn't go that far, but did gush about the day and how amazing Lindsay is to Al and Kelly.</p>
							<h2>Long Distance Dating</h2>
							<p>And so began long distance dating. Neither of us knew what we were getting into, except that we would be travelling a lot. Between our D.C. trip and the move (10 months), we saw each other at least every month. This is something like 35,000 miles travelled over 10 months. Long distance relationships aren't easy, but as two young professionals who travel for work frequently, we developed a lot of good skills to maintain a relationship while travelling. Frequent phone calls, lots of Facetime, the ability to perfectly sync a movie, and falling asleep on the phone.</p>

					<h4>About This Website</h4>
					<p>I bet most of you think this website was prompted by Lindsay. You are, in fact, incorrect. Early on, before even properly engaged, Tim said he wanted a wedding website. Lindsay said, "noooo, we don't have a cute enough 'how we met' story! If you insist, I suppose we could put when we first knew we were in love." Tim then shared that when he first knew was when Lindsay peed on the side of the road on their first trip (/second date) to California. At that moment, Lindsay knew that she definitely did NOT want a website - but, seeing as she has agreed to support Tim in all his pursuits, this website has been born. Website created by Tim, because The Knot just wasn't good enough.</p>
